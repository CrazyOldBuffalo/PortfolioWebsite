        <h3> University & Current Education</h3>
        <p> As mentioned above I am currently studying at Sheffield Hallam University, working to achieve a degree in software engineering, this came after completing a foundation year in computing at the same university the previous year. My main aspirations of the course are to complete the degree with hopefully a 2.1 or ideally a first, giving me the best chances of finding employment and starting a career in an area that I love and enjoy. </p>
        <p> As things stand (Semester 1) the majority of my assignments and submissions have been of the upper boundaries of marks, with the main assignments having a mark of 85 and 65 out of 100 (a 1st and 2.1) which is showing a good standing for the first year so far, and I'm hoping this will continue throughout the rest of the year and onwards.</p>
        <h3> Past Education</h3>
        <p> Having completed GCSES I moved on to do an A-level in Computing, Geography and Biology, but found that A-level didn't suit me at that time. I instead moved to a BTEC in computing which I successfully completed and passed. After this I tried to find employment and instead found an apprenticeship which I focused on and managed to work my way through with ease, wanting to move on to a level 4 apprenticeship. During my apprenticeship I studied computing whilst working as a Technical Support Assistant. This unfortunately never happened but in it's place I did move on to university which can be seen as the better outcome from this.</p>
