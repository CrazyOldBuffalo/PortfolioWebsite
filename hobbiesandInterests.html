        <h3> Hobbies & Interests</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="sub">
        <h4> I've developed a wide range of interests and hobbies, with some being centered elsewhere not just with my primary interest in computing and software development. My main interest are within computing itself but I also have some activity based hobbies as well that I like to partake in 1-2 times a month which keeps me interacting socially with people, as well as going to numerous social activities with my society at university. During my foundation year I joined a society at university, which is a varied group of people all interested in the same hobby as myself. We get along well together and make each other laugh and drink socially regularly. </h4>

        <h4>Computing Based Hobbies/Interests</h4>
        <p> I developed an interest in computing from the age of 12, using a computer for basic tasks and educational gaming. Whilst little experimentation or advanced tasks were done (partially due to limitations on equipment available <i> Using a Mac Powerbook from 1996/1997</i>). This soon developed further through high school as I gained more interest in the subject and started using different features and tools. I started gaining an interest in the creative side of computing, such as photo-editing using photoshop and powerpoint presentations. Over time at college I developed these creative skills into software development and website development through the multiple units that I covered during the course and found all these areas enjoyable and entertaining to watch something I created take shape and eventially be completed.</p>
        <p> Alongside developing an interest in this area I also took a technical interest in hardware and computing technologies, with releases of new hardware and technologies happening every year understanding what these technologies offer and how they are implemented in computer systems. I like to keep up to date with these technologies and use theis knowledge in my interest of building my own PC's using components, which is something i've had success with in the past on 3 occasions creating a computer that is powerful and future-proof for new techologies and developments. This does lead on to my other interest of gaming which I like to perform to wind down after a period of work or in between coursework, it's not just a solitary hobby and I often play together with friends (both within and outside the society). This allows me to develop and use communication and teamwork skills in various areas of life not just behind a screen.</p>

        <h4> University Hobbies/Interests</h4>
        <p> Within university I'm a member of the Airsoft Society (More on this later) within the society I regularly go to the social activities engaging in the variety of drinking, chatting and joking to be a contributive member of the society. In the year I've spent in the society so far I've become very close and good friends of the society committee and able to develop good friendships with them, at the moment I'm not looking to become a committee member but this may be a possibility in the near future. I'm always keen to help the committee with any ghear that neds sorting out of extra items that need carrying to provide any extra help needed where possible, this also comes in the form of taking photographs at one of our events for publicitiy with the student union. </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Airsoft</h4>
        <p> Without a doubt my biggest interest is Airsoft, A team-based game/sport similar to paintball. Of which I partake in this with the society at least once a month, we work as a team to complete objectives or complete tasks using both physical and mental skills to work together to win. I've been playing the sport for nearly 2 years now and been a member of the society for 1 (which joining has helped my find more friends and go more frequently). Playing the sport regularly helps me keep my fitness and develop it further and also build and develop my mental skills in communication, teamwork and even motivation to help keep people moving and contributing to the team. A great part of the hobby is building and collect various kit to look the part whilst on the field, I'm always wanting to add new items or make changes to my kit and equipment, not just for on the field but also through photos and pictures. Which I mentioned above is something I've taken part in to help the society, you can see some of these below and also on my instagram which is linked in the contact page.</p>
