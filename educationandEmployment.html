        <h3> Education </h3>
        <p>In Regard to my education I have already covered a portion of my education on the About Me page on this website. But I will go into more detail on what I am currently studying and my previous education in further detail here, including my GCSE results.</p>
        <h4> Current Education </h4>
        <p> As I previously mentioned I'm currently studying at Sheffield Hallam University</p>
        <div id="uni">
            <img src="Images\shu.jpeg" alt="Sheffield Hallam University" />
            <p> I'm currently studying my first year of software engineering after successfully completing my foundation year at the university. The current situation of the course is going well and I'm continuously achieving high marks on my coursework and assignments (A brief overview of current units can be shown below). I've currently worked on a variety of assignments and coursework both individual and group work, all of which I've tried to complete to a high standard and quality or tried to put as much effort in as possible and contributed as much as possible. Whilst on the course I've built up a group of friends who I can have a laugh with and are able to help when needed with coursework or any issues arise. </p>

        <h4> Past Education</h4>
        <p> My previous education has primarily covered my interest in computing and developed on this further. I attempted to study a-levels at college, but the style of examination and studying wasn't something that suited me, and thus I dropped out of these after the first year to complete a BTEC which was more to my liking. I successfully passed the course with a: PPP in 2015, although due to personal issues and a feeling of disinterest in education at the time contributed to my current grade I did still achieve a high attendance.</p>
        <p> After completion I took a gap year and attempted to find employment and in doing so found an apprenticeship which I easily passed and worked hard at to complete successfully. With the job providing financial stability and a drive to progress further into the business I wanted to move on to a level 4 apprenticeship, but due to complications this wasn't possible and instead I moved on to work on my foundation year. I was hard working and always put as much effort as possible into all assignments and tasks given and ensured that all work I completed was on time or as close to it as possible. This allowed me to easily complete the apprenticeship with the passing grade <i>(which was the highest grade possible)</i></p>
        <p> With my GCSE's I tried my hardest to achieve my grades, I was a hard worker and had high (90+ %) attendance at school with my speciality and favourite subjects being Computing and Science. My time spent at school helped my to develop my interests in these areas, especially in computing and also helped with the fundamental skills that I would develop later through further education.</p>
        <p> The listing of all grades and achievements is as follows:</p>
        <div id="results">
            <ul>
                <li><b>(2016 - 2017: 3AAA - PP)</b>Level 3 - IT Professional Competence & ICT Systems and Principles</li>
                <li><b>(2013 - 2015: Sheffield City College - PPP)</b> - Level 3 BTEC Diploma in Computing & IT</li>
                <li><b>(2007 - 2012: Stocksbridge High School) - 6 GCSE's at Grade C or above; Including Maths, English & ICT </b></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <h3> Employment </h3>
        <p> Whilst my employment history is rather short it is something that I hope to build upon after leaving university, and it does cover some computing experience as well which will help me work my way into a computing career in the future. In the experience that I have gained I have built my communication, team building and customer service skills and built on these through all my previous jobs. Below is a list of all jobs I have worked including skills gained and dates. </p>
        <h4> Bar Staff (20<sup>th</sup> July 2019 - Current)</h4>
        <p>Part time bar staff for the Venue (Stocksbridge) serving soft and alcoholic drinks to customers. Work involved a large amount of teamwork to ensure people weren’t waiting too long for their drinks whilst also being able to process payments using cash registers and cards. Whilst working I always try to have a positive attitude and joke around with my colleagues to make the shift more enjoyable for everyone and help it to pass by faster. I'm working part time here to help subsidise my studies and support my hobbies and interest whilst at university, helping overall with my financial situation. </p>

        <h4>Assistant IT Technician at DXC Technologies (June 2016 - December 2017)</h4>
        <p> I worked at DXC as part of my Level 3 Apprenticeship which I successfully completed in July of this year. I fulfilled two roles during my time at DXC, the first was as a 1st line Help-desk technician answering phones from users that were having issues with their equipment or software. Most of this job involved me filling in electronic tickets using the companies ticketing system for them to be passed on to a further support team as well as performing troubleshooting and resolution activities before they are passed on. As a secondary role I also worked as an administrator managing tickets by sending them to support staff and keeping their workloads full, whilst also dealing with management requests by communicating with them and creating request tickets. </p>
        <h4>Match Day Staff (12th - 26th August 2014)</h4>
        <p>Worked part time for Sheffield United as Match Day Staff serving drinks and food for customers. Teamwork and communication skills were essential for the role especially during half-time when there would be a rush, I was required to be able to handle the pressure of serving as many people as possible in a small space of time. </p>
        <h4>IT Department at Sheffield Futures (12th - 26th August 2014) <i>Volunteering work</i> </h4>
        <p>I helped move large quantities of old computers from one location to the other and removed the hard drives from these whilst stacking them in corresponding piles and helped to sort out their storeroom ready for the computers to be put into it. This involved me to be very hardworking and to be committed as there was nearly 200 computers that all had to be transported and sorted into piles.</p>
